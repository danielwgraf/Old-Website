description: I created and designed a website for the Soundbytes, an a cappella group at CMU, by using the Jekyll Ruby gem.  Based off of a mixture of different templates, the website itself was constructed and redesigned to fit the needs of the group, including easily updateable content and a blog page for the group to share future info regarding their events.
